# ajax-blog
Simple blog with dynamic loaing of new pages

Blog was made on top of the [brilliant tutorial](https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django) from DjangoCentral.

Blog was made on pure Django and JQuery with usage of Ajax requests.

Basic idea of ajax usage - load new articles when at the bottom end of the page.
